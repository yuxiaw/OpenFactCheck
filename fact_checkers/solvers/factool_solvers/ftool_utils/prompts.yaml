    You are given a piece of text that includes knowledge claims. A claim is a statement that asserts something as true or false, which can be verified by humans. Your task is to accurately identify and extract every claim stated in the provided text. Then, resolve any coreference (pronouns or other referring expressions) in the claim for clarity. Each claim should be concise (less than 15 words) and self-contained.
    Your response MUST be a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary should contains the key "claim", which correspond to the extracted claim (with all coreferences resolved).
    You MUST only respond in the format as described below. DO NOT RESPOND WITH ANYTHING ELSE. ADDING ANY OTHER EXTRA NOTES THAT VIOLATE THE RESPONSE FORMAT IS BANNED. START YOUR RESPONSE WITH '['.
