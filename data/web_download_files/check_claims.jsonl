{"whole_document_context":"Under New York law, a breach of contract occurs when there is a failure to perform a duty or obligation defined in the contract. Some elements of breach of contract under New York law include:\\n\\n1. The existence of a valid contract: A valid contract must exist between the parties, and it must be clear and unambiguous.\\n\\n2. Breach of the contract: One party must have failed to perform a duty or obligation as defined in the contract.\\n\\n3. Damages: The other party must have suffered damages as a result of the breach.\\n\\nSome of the key cases that have defined these elements under New York law include:\\n\\n1. Beach v. Tourtellot (1922): In this case, the court held that a breach of contract occurs when there is a failure to perform a duty or obligation defined in the contract.\\n\\n2. Keywell Corp. v. Weinstein (1991): This case established that damages are an essential element of a breach of contract claim under New York law.\\n\\n3. Scarola v. Chicago Title Ins. Co. (2005): This case clarified that the existence of a valid contract is a necessary element of a breach of contract claim, and that clear and unambiguous contract terms are essential to establishing the existence of a valid contract.\\n\\nOverall, these cases demonstrate the importance of understanding and properly defining the elements of breach of contract under New York law, and the need for clear and unambiguous contract terms to establish a valid contract.","claim":"Co.
